### Micro-computer organization and its basic components:

    Carry Look
    Ahead adders, Carry Save adder, Multipliers (e.g. Boothâ€™s algorithm),
    Divider, Fixed and Floating point (IEEE754) number representations,
    Finite State Machine (FSM) representation.

### Basic Accumulator based CPU:

    Organization, instruction set, programming considerations, RISC,
    CISC Processors- Instruction Sets, addressing Modes.

[Machine Instructions](./slides/Section2.pptx)

### Introduction to the Basic MIPS:

    Instruction Set.

### Fixed Point ALUs:

    Combinational and Sequential ALUs, ALU Expansion.

### Floating Point Arithmetic circuits:

    Pipelined Processing, Systolic Arrays, resolving structural, data, control, and name hazards; analyzing
    processor performance, Memory mapping(e.g. RAM, cache); Non-blocking cache memories; memory protection,
    translation and virtualization, synchronization, consistency and coherence, direct-mapped and associative
    caches; write-through and write-back caches, pipelined caches, analyzing memory performance.

[Processing Unit](./slides/Section3.pptx)

### Processor Architecture:

    Super- scalar execution, Out-of-order execution, register renaming, memory disambiguation, branch
    prediction, speculative execution; multithreaded, VLIW, and SIMD processors.

[Composite Architecture](./slides/Section6.pptx)

### Hardwired and Micro-programmed Control Design.

    Buses, bus arbitration, I/O control,
    interrupts and direct memory access, virtual memory mapping and
    addressing.
