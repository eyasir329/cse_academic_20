[L1 - Basic C++](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/cs1020e/lectures/L1%20-%20Basic%20C++.pdf)

### Introduction:

    Introduction to Data Structures, idea of abstract data
    type, preliminary idea of algorithm runtime complexity (Big Oh
    notation), preliminary idea of data structure space complexity.

[Array and Pointer](./slides/Chapter%204_Arrays%20Records%20and%20Pointers%20pdf.pdf)

### Linked List:

    Singly/doubly/circular linked lists, basic operations on
    linked list (insertion, deletion and traverse), dynamic array and its
    application.

[Linked List](./slides/Chapter%205_Linked%20Lists.ppt)

### Stack and Queue:

    Basic stack operations (push/pop/peek),
    stack-class implementation using Array and linked list, in-fix to
    post-fix expressions conversion and evaluation, balancing parentheses
    using stack, basic queue operations (enqueue, dequeue), circular
    queue/ dequeue, queue-class implementation using array and linked
    list, application- Josephous problem, palindrome checker using stack
    and queue.

[Stack, Queue and Recursion](./slides/Chapter%206_Stacks%20Queue%20and%20Recursion.pdf)

### Recursion:

    Basic idea of recursion (3 laws-base case, call
    itself, move towards base case by state change), tracing output of a
    recursive function, applications- merge
    sort, permutation, combination.

### Sorting:

    Insertion sort, selection sort, bubble sort,
    merge sort, quick sort (randomized quick sort), distribution sort
    (counting sort, radix sort, bucket sort), lower bounds for sorting,
    external sort.

[Sorting](./slides/Sorting%20Algorithms.pptx)

### Binary Tree:

    Binary tree representation using array
    and pointers, traversal of Binary Tree (in-order, pre-order and post-
    order).

### Binary Search Tree:

    BST representation, basic operations on
    BST (creation, insertion, deletion, querying and traversing),
    application- searching, sets.

### Searching:

    Linear search, binary
    Search, application of Binary Search- finding element in a sorted
    array, finding nth root of a real number, solving equations.

### Heap:

    Min-heap, max-heap, Fibonacci-heap, applications-priority queue, heap
    sort.

### General Tree:

    Implementation, application of general tree- file
    system.

[Tree](./slides/Chapter%207_Tree.ppt)

### Disjoint Set:

    Union find, path compression.

### Huffman Coding:

    Implementation, application- Compression.

[Haffman Codes](./slides/Huffman%20Codes.ppt)

### Graph:

    Graph representation
    (adjacency
    matrix/adjacency list), basic operations on graph
    (node/edge insertion and deletion), traversing a graph: breadth-first
    search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), graph-bicoloring.

[Graph and their application](./slides/Chapter%208_Graph%20and%20their%20Applications.ppt)

### Self-balancing Binary Search Tree:

    AVL tree (rotation, insertion).

### Set Operations:

    Set representation using bitmask, set/clear bit, querying
    the status of a bit, toggling bit values, LSB, application of set
    operations.

### String ADT:

    The concatenation of two strings, the extraction of substrings, searching a string for a matching
    substring, parsing.
